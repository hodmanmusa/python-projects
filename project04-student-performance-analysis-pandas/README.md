# Student Performance Analysis (Learning Project)

## Overview

This project is a learning-focused data analysis exercise created to practice data manipulation and exploratory data analysis using Python. The dataset contains student performance scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and background information.

The main goal of this project is to apply concepts learned in the Data Manipulation with pandas course and to gain hands-on experience working with real-world data.

---

## Project Objectives

- Practice data cleaning and transformation using pandas
- Perform group-based analysis using `groupby` and pivot tables
- Compare average student scores across different categories
- Create clear and meaningful data visualizations
- Write simple and accurate explanations for analytical results

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle:

**Students Performance in Exams**  
Source: Kaggle  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

The dataset includes:
- Math, reading, and writing scores
- Gender
- Test preparation status
- Lunch type
- Parental education level
- Anonymized demographic groups

This dataset is commonly used for educational and practice purposes.

---

## Key Findings

- Female students perform better in reading and writing, while math scores are similar across genders.
- Students who completed the test preparation course have higher average scores.
- Students with standard lunch tend to perform better than those with free or reduced lunch.
- Higher parental education levels are associated with higher student performance.
- Most students fall into the medium performance category.

---

## Limitations

- The dataset is limited in size and may not represent all student populations.
- Demographic groups are anonymized and do not represent real ethnic identities.
- The analysis is descriptive and does not include statistical testing.
- Observed relationships show associations, not causation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates foundational data analysis skills using pandas and data visualization tools. It serves as a practical learning exercise to build confidence in data exploration, summarization, and interpretation. Future work could include statistical analysis or predictive modeling.
